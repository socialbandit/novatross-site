			  <h4><strong>Is the AWV worthwhile?</strong></h4>
                
              <p>
			     
				  A 30 minute visit, administered by your Nurse or CMA can substantially increase your practice’s revenue.  The incidental follow-ups from the AWV can also generate very significant revenue while greatly enhancing your patient care.

				  <p>You probably provide Annual Physicals for <strong>SOME </strong> of your Medicare patients, but not the comprehensive Annual Wellness Visit (AWV). The AWV is a <strong> FREE</strong> 
													wellness visit for <strong>ALL</strong> of your Medicare patients, active and inactive. The wellness 
													portion of the visit includes functional capacity, safety, cognitive evaluation and depression 
													screen along with other providers of care, diet, exercise and activity level. These components 
													are typically <strong> NOT </strong> captured during the Annual Physical (see chart ). <p>
				  <h4></h4>	
                <p>The WellTrackOne AWV system provides critical information about the patient that you wouldn’t always see 
									from your other visits. Many of our physicians have told us that our system has helped them identify
									problems in their Medicare population that they didn’t know existed previously. </p>
									<b>Wait, can't I just do the AWV with my EMR ?</b>
								<p class='section-paragraph'>	There is no doubt that your EMR can create great templates. 
								But it’s the risk factors, 5-year plan and Personalized Health Advice that is 
								often omitted by EMRs and those are required by Medicare. To maximize AWV performance our system is coupled with a highly efficient “outreach” method. </p>
